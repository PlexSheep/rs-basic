//! How to calc the factorial n! with just a single line, no imperative style loops, no vars.

/// Task from rustlings

/// Do not use:
/// - early returns (using the `return` keyword explicitly)
///
/// Try not to use:
/// - imperative style loops (for/while)
/// - additional variables
///
/// For an extra challenge, don't use:
/// - recursion

/// then a macro. Here is a simple version of it.
